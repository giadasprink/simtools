These are the spectra needed to reproduce Figures 8 and 9 from Schwieterman, Cockell, and Meadows (Astrobiology, 15:5), except the true Earth's modeled
spectrum can be found at (http://vpl.astro.washington.edu/spectra/planetary/epoxi.htm). File headers include relevant information regarding the sub-solar and sub-observer latitude, and the two columns (beginning at line 29) are wavelength (in um) and radiance (in W/m2/um/sr)
