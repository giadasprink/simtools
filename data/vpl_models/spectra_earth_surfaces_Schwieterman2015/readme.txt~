These are spectra presented in Schwieterman, Cockell, Meadows 2015 (Astrobiology, 15:5) Figure 6, using surface albedos obtained from the USGS spectral library (Clark et al. 2007) and other sources. The surface albedos used are in the albedo file. The atmosphere file used is iccrm_62.atm. 

The columns in the .rad files are:

Column 1: wavelength (microns), Column 2: wavenumber (cm^-1), Column 3: incident stellar spectrum (W/m^2/um), and Column 4: top-of-atmosphere spectral irradiance (W/m^2/um). The remaining columns are radiance streams (W/m^2/um/str) for different zenith angles. The only information necessary to reproduce the figure is columns 1,3, and 4.
