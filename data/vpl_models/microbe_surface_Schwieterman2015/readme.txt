These are the spectra presented in Schwieterman, Cockell, Meadows (Astrobiology, 15:5) 2015 Figure 5 using the reflectance spectra of microbes as the surface albedo. 
The reflectance spectra are available on the VPL pigment database (http://vplapps.astro.washington.edu/pigments). The atmosphere file used is iccrm_62.atm. 

The columns in the .rad files are:

Column 1: wavelength (microns), Column 2: wavenumber (cm^-1), Column 3: incident stellar spectrum (W/m^2/um), and Column 4: top-of-atmosphere spectral irradiance (W/m^2/um). The remaining columns are radiance streams (W/m^2/um/str) for different zenith angles. The only information necessary to reproduce the figure is columns 1,3, and 4.
